### Hybrid A* Path Planner for the KTH Research Concept Vehicle

The code in this repository is the result of my master's thesis which I am currently writing at the Integrated Research Lab (ITRL) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
The code is documented [here](http://karlkurzer.github.io/path_planner) (work in progress).


The goal of the thesis and hence this code is to create a real-time path planning algorithm for the nonholonomic Research Concept Vehicle (RCV). The algorithm uses a binary obstacle map as an input, generated using LIDAR mounted on top of the vehicle. The algorithm is being developed using C++ due to real-time requirements in combination with ROS to ensure modularity and portability as well as using RViz as a visualization/simulation environment.

##### Key Characteristics
* Sampling in continuous space with 72 different headings per cell (5Â° discretization)
* Constrained Heuristic - _nonholonomic without obstacles_
* Unconstrained Heuristic - _holonomic with obstacles_
* Dubin's Shot
* C++ real-time implementation (~10 Hz)

Large parts of the implementation are closely related to the hybrid A* algorithm developed by Dmitri Dolgov and Sebastian Thrun (_Path Planning for Autonomous Vehicles in Unknown Semi-structured Environments_ DOI: 10.1177/0278364909359210)

#### Dependencies
The package has a dependency on [OMPL](http://ompl.kavrakilab.org/).

#### Setup

Run the following command to clone, build, and launch the package:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src \
&& git clone https://github.com/karlkurzer/path_planner.git  \
&& cd .. \
&& catkin_make \
&& source devel/setup.bash \
&& rospack profile \
&& roslaunch hybrid_astar manual.launch
```
#### Visualization (Rviz)
1. Add -> By Topic -> /map, /path, /pathVehicle, (/visualizeNode2DPoses)
2. Click 2D Pose Estimate to set a start point on the map
3. Click 2D Nav Goal to set a goal point on the map
4. Wait for the path being searched! (this process can be visualized [optional)
